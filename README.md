# Vault 712

Vault 712 is a Grin installer for the MimbleWimble protocol. It will install Grin and all prerequisites on your linux computer. Vault 712 is also an interactive shell that allows you to run the Grin server for mining, the Grin wallet and sending/receiving the cryptocurrency Grin. 

## Getting Started

Download all files below to the same directory

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BloddyBaron/Vault712/master/vault712.sh
```

Run the main shell script by executing ```./vault712``` on the command line interface 

Run ```chmod +x on vault712.sh``` to make sure you have permissions to run it on the command line interface

Follow the instructions to proceed.

NOTE: Grin is not yet live, and is only on testnet. Do NOT use if you dont know what you are doing!

This interactive shell script is to facilitate testing for the Grin blockchain. The installation script works independently of starting a node and server, and can be closed and opened independently to run different optional commands for Grin.
